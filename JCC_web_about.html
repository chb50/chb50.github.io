				<center><h2>About the Japanese Conversation Club</h2></center>
				<hr/>
				<p><center>The Japanese Conversation Club is dedicated to providing ambitious Japanese language students with an environment in which they can practice and learn with fellow peers. We exist to provide what the Japanese class cannot, a chance to learn and practice real-world Japanese, beyond the textbooks. Furthermore, we aim to spread our Japanese knowledge and resources to all of our club members, regardless of skill level.</center></p>
				<h3>Finding our club</h3>
				<p>We meet every Wednesday evening, at 9:15 PM at Scott Hall room 201 on the College Avenue campus. You can also find us online at our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/RU.JCC/" target="_blank">Facebook</a> page.</p>
				<h3>Daily Club Activities</h3>
				<p>As you may have guessed, one of our main club activities is Japanese conversation amongst our peers, but thankfully, this can be accomplished in many ways. Our daily activities consist of:
				<ul>
					<li>discussing various topics in Japanese</li>
					<li>practicing listening comprehension with Japanese songs or videos</li>
					<li>discussing Japanese culture, how the culture shapes the language, and how the language shapes the culture</li>
					<li>discussing and learning the complex writing system of Japanese</li>
					<li>skyping with our friends in Japan who are Japanese natives!</li>
				</ul>
				In Addition, Classes for Japanese beginners are held by our more experienced members every week, so don't worry about not knowing enough Japanese, we'll teach it to you!</p>
				<h3>Special Club Activities and Events</h3>
				<p>Beyond our daily activities, we also have a couple of special events at our club. Every semester, we take a trip to New York to visit various Japanese stores such as Book Off and Kinokuniya and have fun with karaoke. Also, every semester, exchange students from our sister school in Kyoto, Ritsumeikan University, come to Rutgers, and they are always eager to meet the American students that are learning Japanese, so they come to our club to visit! This is a prime opportunity for our members to practice their Japanese with native Japanese peers and make new friends from overseas!</p>
